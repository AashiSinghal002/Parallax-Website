      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife.
        Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to 
        the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things 
        exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. 
        It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks,
         forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human 
         intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured 
         objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless 
         qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more 
         traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a d
         istinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood 
         as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.

        Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural 
        features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. 
        Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is 
        the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. 
        Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar 
        regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide 
        equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] Precipitation 
        varies widely with location, from several metres of water per 
        year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface 
        is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents 
        and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.

        Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather,
        such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of
        energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has
        evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden
        changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the
        vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.
        Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors
        are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo,
        greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's
        orbit. Based on historical and geological records, the Earth is known to have
        undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.
